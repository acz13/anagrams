Since I use Java so rarely, I doubt I'll remember how to build and run
this ...

* Install Netbeans.  I sanity-checked these instructions using
  Netbeans 6.7.1.  As of October 2017, you can find the current
  version at
  https://netbeans.org/downloads/start.html?platform=macosx&lang=en&option=javase

* "File" / "Open Project" ... navigate to this directory, which will
  appear with a different icon than other directories.

* Hit F6 to build and run it.
