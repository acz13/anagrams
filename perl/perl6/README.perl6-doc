The best perl6 quick cheat sheet I've found is in
https://github.com/audreyt/pugs/tree/master/docs/Perl6/Overview

http://perlgeek.de/en/article/5-to-6 is pretty good, albeit terse.

Synopses -- hard to understand, but presumably complete and
authoritative -- are at http://perlcabal.org/syn/

I've heard that the official definition of Perl 6 will be: any program
that passes the "spec tests".  And those tests live at
https://github.com/perl6/roast.
