A not-bad intro is at http://perl6intro.com/

The best perl6 quick cheat sheet I've found --although it's years old
by now -- is in
https://github.com/audreyt/pugs/tree/master/docs/Perl6/Overview

http://perlgeek.de/en/article/5-to-6 is pretty good, albeit terse.

Synopses -- hard to understand, but at one point, presumably, were
complete and authoritative -- are at http://perlcabal.org/syn/.
There's a warning banner now, though, saying they may be out of date.

I've heard that the official definition of Perl 6 will be: any program
that passes the "spec tests".  And those tests live at
https://github.com/perl6/roast.
