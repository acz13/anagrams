For no good reason, I'm wondering if I could merge all these
mostly-the-same-but-slightly-different versions into one.

* Here are the ways in which the various implementations most seem to
  differ: 

** hash tables

You'd think there'd be some hash-table SRFI that I could use in all of
these versions (there's a SRFI 69, but it appears to be supported only
by PLT scheme v300 and Chicken).

** module systems

** bignums

Some have 'em; some don't.

** regular expressions

SRFI?  Prolly not.

Note that R6RS standardizes hash tables, module systems, and bignums.

* SRFI 7

This SRFI might make it easier to write portable code.  Here are
implementations that claim to support it:

** scheme48
** mzscheme
** chicken
** scsh
