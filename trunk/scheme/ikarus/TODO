There are a couple of kludges to work around missing features in
Ikarus; remove them once those features are added.  The one I can
think of offhand is: Ikarus lacks "eqv" hash tables, but two equal
bignums aren't "eq?", so in order to use bignums as hash table keys, I
convert them to symbols first.
