  contains wonderfully-commented C++ code that does roughly what I do.

* http://www.hinterlands.org/clabbers/
  is a program written by "SlayerXP", a denizen of the #svn IRC
  channel on irc.freenode.net.  It's not quite the same as mine: it
  finds all words that can be made from a pile of letters, including
  those that don't use all the letters.  For example, given "dgo", my
  program will find "god" and "dog"; clabbers will find both of those,
  but also "go" and "do".

* http://fourmilab.ch/anagram/
  (John Walker's anagrams program) is essentially identical to the
  algorithm here.  But I didn't look at that before writing this
  stuff, I swear!  Great minds apparently think alike.
